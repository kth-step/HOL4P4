Input strategy:

Some things we can parse, we can present as-is already with the current P4 semantics.

"statements" is our stmt, often wrapped inside "body" which can be pretty much disregarded. "expr" is our e.

Some other things only exist implicitly in our model: global variables (presumed to be initialised at the start), functions et cetera.


"simple_input" is from filter.p4:

	extern packet_in {}

	parser filter(packet_in packet, out bool drop);
	package Filter(filter f);

This is generated by 

	petr4 typecheck -json -I ~/Documents/Didrik/P4/petr4/ci-test/type-checking/p4include ~/Documents/Didrik/P4/petr4/ci-test/type-checking/testdata/p4_16_samples/filter.p4
