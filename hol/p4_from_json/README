Input strategy:

Some things we can parse, we can present as-is already with the current P4 semantics.

Some other things exist only more implicitly in our model: global variables (presumed to be initialised at the start), functions et cetera.


"simple_input" is from filter.p4:

	extern packet_in {}

	parser filter(packet_in packet, out bool drop);
	package Filter(filter f);

This is generated by 

	petr4 -json -I ~/Documents/installed-git-repos/petr4/ci-test/p4include ~/Documents/installed-git-repos/petr4/ci-test/testdata/p4_16_samples/filter.p4
	
"pretty" versions of input files simply have a few line breaks where appropriate to be more readable.

##Examples

Generate json representations of .p4 files via petr4:

	./generate_jsons.sh test-examples
