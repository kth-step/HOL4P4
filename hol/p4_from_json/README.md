# Import Tool

This directory contains an import tool to obtain HOL4P4 representations of P4 programs and STF specifications.
The simplest way to try this out is to use the `Makefile` in the root directory of this repository: `make validate`. You can also run them directly from this directory via `.validate.sh`.

## Shell scripts

`petr4_json_export.sh` uses petr4 to transform .p4 programs to JSON. It takes a path to a directory with .p4 programs and a path to common includes (e.g. architecture descriptions such as v1model.p4, ...) as command line arguments and will transform all .p4 programs found to .json representation.

`strip_json_info.sh` takes a file name as a command-line argument and tries to remove debug information from the JSON in the file, shrinking the size of the .json considerably.

`petr4_to_hol4p4.sh` takes a path and a log file as command-line arguments and tries to transform all .json files found in the path into HOL4P4 .sml files. This uses a hard-coded remove_debug flag to decide whether the `strip_json_info.sh` script will be used on all .json files involved.

`petr4_to_hol4p4_dir.sh` is the version of `petr4_to_hol4p4.sh` for entire directories. It takes a path and a number of threads. Rule of thumb: don't use all (virtual) cores on your computer, or instability may ensue. Note that this has a hard-coded log variable for the log file to write results for every test, by default `petr4_to_hol4p4_stf.log`.

`validate.sh` runs both `petr4_json_export.sh` and `petr4_to_hol4p4_dir.sh` targeted at `validation_tests`, and compiles the result with `Holmake` afterward. Note that this takes a number of parallel processes to use as an optional argument.

## HOL4 files

`excluded.sml` contains a list of tuples of categories (categorized by what blocks them from being parsed, as a string description) of tests and the test names themselves. Used to not waste time trying to re-transform tests you know will fail.

`parse_jsonScript.sml` is a theory of generic JSON objects.

`parse_stf.sml` parses an `.stf` specification of a test.

`petr4_to_hol4p4.sml` is the internal mechanism of `petr4_to_hol4p4_dir.sh` that does the actual format transformation from petr4 JSON to HOL4P4. `petr4_to_hol4p4Script.sml` holds the theorems needed for this, and `petr4_to_hol4p4Syntax.sml` the syntax library.

## Program transformations

In order to accommodate P4 programs in the syntax of HOL4P4, a bit of desugaring must be done.

### Nested control blocks

The most significant program transformation concerns inlining of nested blocks. Currently, only nested control blocks are supported and not nested parser blocks. This works in the following manner:

When instantiated blocks are applied (called), the apply block (body) of the nested block is inlined in the parent block, with all variables and tables prefixed with the instance name. The copy-in copy-out mechanism of block parameters is handled as follows:

Copy-in:
	* If the parameter is out, then the (prefixed) parameter is havoc-ed (by using arb_from_tau to assign a value with all bits as ARBs to it)
	* Otherwise, assign the argument to the (prefixed) parameter.
	
Copy-out:
	* If the parameter is out or inout, then assign the (prefixed) parameter to the L-value of the argument.
	* Otherwise, do nothing (note that this is safe since the import tool will halt with an error if prefixed variables of the inlined programmable block intersect with those of the parent block)
	
Actions (local functions) of inlined blocks must be able to access the block variables of their respective block. For this reason, all block variables of the nested block are added (prefixed) to the declaration list of the parent block (as opposed to being introduced inside a block) with their copy-out L-values set to NONE.

As an exception to the above, the local function maps `b_func_map` of the parent and child blocks are merged with no prefixing of action names, with the import tool halting with an error if name collisions are found for different entries.

After processing the entire program is complete, blocks which only occur as nested blocks will be removed from the pblock_map to avoid clutter.
	
Note that if the same block is instantiated twice, it uses different tables, while if it is instantiated once but applied twice, the same table is used.

This method cannot distinguish between tables of the same name in non-nested control blocks, nor between instances of the same name in separate programmable blocks. To avoid name collisions across nestings, all table names with dots are disallowed by the import tool.

Also, this method does not permit nested blocks from using a return statement to finish. Accordingly, the import tool halts with an error if inlining of programmable blocks with bodies containing return statements is attempted.

The new programmable block-variables resulting from the above procedure will be added to a "taboo list" - if these are encountered among the programmable block-variables of the parent block or in any variable declaration before the inlined block, the import tool will halt with an error.

### Select expressions

Select expressions with no default case will get a new default case that maps to the state "set_no_match", which contains only a "verify(false, error.NoMatch)" statement. The import tool will halt with an error if "set_no_match" is encountered among the regular states of the P4 program. The "set_no_match" state will only appear in programs with default-less select expressions.

### Table application in expressions

To accommodate table application in expressions and their returned structs, the following can be done:

* All actions are given two additional in-directed parameters called "from_table" and "hit". The import tool disallows P4 programs with actions with pre-existing parameters named "from_table" and "hit".
* An assignment is prepended to the body of all actions, which contain a conditional statement (on "from_table") with a then-case with an assignment to "gen_apply_result", which is a global variable (the import tool disallows P4 programs to have global variables, programmable-block variables, declared variables and action arguments called "gen_apply_result").
* Actions resulting from table application pass true to "from_table", other usages pass false. Default actions of tables pass false as argument to "hit". Actions corresponding to table entries pass true. Action calls in the regular P4 code pass `ARB`.
* Whenever a table application is encountered by the import tool inside an expression `e` in a statement `stmt`, the following is done:
  + A new statement `stmt1` consisting of assignment to a temporary variable `tmp1` of the sub-expression `e1` preceding the table application in evaluation order (e.g. the first operand of a binary expression, if the table application is the second), if any, is constructed.
  + Appended sequentially to `stmt1` is `stmt2`: first the apply statement corresponding to the apply expression (same arguments), then an assignment to the global variable "apply_result1" of the struct expression `{ hit : apply_result_hit ; miss : !apply_result_hit ; action_result : table_bitv }`, where `table_bitv` is the action name serialised to a bitvector based on order of declaration in the program. In case the apply expression is occupying a short-circuit position in `e`, `stmt2` is enclosed in the appropriate conditional statement on `tmp1`.
  + Inside `e`, the variable `tmp1` takes the position of `e1` and `apply_result1` that of the table application.
  + The above procedure is then followed recursively, in case the apply expression was encountered as the first operand of `e`, incrementing the indices of `apply_result` and `tmp`.
* Occurrences of the table name in the code are then serialised in the same manner as for the `apply_result` struct.

Currently, a limited version of the above transformation is performed which only supports single table applications inside the expression of switch statements.

## How to debug test files

Use `debug_arch_from_step`:
```
 val ((ab_list, pblock_map, ffblock_map, input_f, output_f, copyin_pbl, copyout_pbl, apply_table_f, ext_map, func_map), ((i, in_out_list, in_out_list', ascope), g_scope_list, arch_frame_list, status)) = debug_arch_from_step "text_arch" test_name_actx test_name_astate nsteps
```

## Adding your own tests
Before performing the steps below, make sure you have ran `make hol && cd hol/p4_from_json && Holmake` in the `HOL4P4` directory to compile the necessary theories (alternatively, `make validate`, which will also run the tests).

Adding your own tests in the same style as HOL4P4â€™s validation tests is simple. To do so, start by taking the P4 program you would want to test and place it in `hol/p4_from_json/user_tests`. For example, take `hol/p4_from_json/validation_tests/arith2-bmv2.p4` with some small modification. Then, you need to add a STF specification (see e.g. `hol/p4_from_json/validation_tests/arith2-bmv2.stf`):

```
# header = { bit<32> a; bit<32> b; bit<8> c; }
# In the output C = A < B

packet 0 00000000 00000001 00
expect 0 00000000 00000001 01

packet 0 00000000 00000000 00
expect 0 00000000 00000000 00

packet 0 00000001 00000000 00
expect 0 00000001 00000000 00

packet 0 00000001 00000002 00
expect 0 00000001 00000002 01

packet 0 00000011 00000022 00
expect 0 00000011 00000022 01

packet 0 FFFFFFFF 00000001 00
expect 0 FFFFFFFF 00000001 00

packet 0 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE 00
expect 0 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE 00
```

Here, `packet` signifies the incoming packet and `expect` the outgoing one, with the first 0 after each of these commands being the port number. You may use * for wildcard bits in both input and output. Adapt as needed for your program, copy the `Holmakefile` from `hol/p4_from_json/validation_tests/` to `hol/p4_from_json/user_tests`, and then run

```
./petr4_json_export.sh user_tests/ p4include/

./petr4_to_hol4p4_dir.sh user_tests/
```

in the `hol/p4_from_json` directory, generating the .sml file (note that hyphens in the .p4 file name will also be replaced with underscores). `petr4_to_hol4p4_dir.sh` takes an optional second argument which is the number of threads which should perform the conversions in parallel, in case you have extra horsepower to spare. To compile the test, then run

	cd user_tests && Holmake arith2_bmv2Theory
